Real Traffic Simulation Scheme

An experimental tool that attempts to bypass anti-spoofing mechanisms
by using similar approach to NAT.


machine running this code must have two interfaces,


interfaces' MAC addresses are hardcoded into the program
you have to manually change them before compile time for now.

Check sample configuration files.

Will improve code and provide more details later.
